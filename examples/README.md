# Examples

This folder contains examples showing how to use `axum-sessions`. Each example is
setup as its own crate so its dependencies are clear.

## Running examples

Examples are intended to be run from the command line. To do so, change to the `examples/` directory and then use cargo:

```sh
$ cargo run -p example-signin
```

Change `signin` to the name of the example you'd like to run.
